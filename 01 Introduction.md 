SDLC process involves collection of software requirements from the customer, 
development of the software by the development team, and testing of functionalities of the software by testers, is well known. 

Introduced in 2009 by patrick debois, the te DevOps is a practice field that covers several disciplines while understanding the functional as well as the technical aspect of the software 
development in an organisation. 
   DevOps is derived by joining two teams "development" and "operations". 


SDLC : 

   Design  
       coding 
           testing 
                 mainternance & support 
                      analysis 


Software testing  

1. manual testing 
2. automation testing 
3. static testing 
4. dynamic testing 

test case design -> test environment setup -> test case execution -> error reporting -> Test closure 

5. black-box testing 
6. white-box testing  
7. functional testing 
8. non-functional testing 
9.  unit testing 
10. integration testing 
11. system testing 


Agile methodology 

Agile testing is a rapid process of software testing that aims towards
increasing the flexibility and effectiveness of the workflow.

Why are Open-Source tools essential for the devops cycle?

Open_source platform allow everyone on the DevOps team to view the state of the application 
being developed, which is very important in DevOps.
