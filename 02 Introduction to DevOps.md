# Introduction to DevOps 

As per the traditional approach of software development, the fundamental operations of development and operations sare demarcated. This primary concern of DevOps is to eliminate the barriers between the teams by changing their culture and mindset. The development and operations activities need to be well-collaborated for delivering high-quality and efficient software in lesser-time.

* Appium
* Bamboo
* CruiseControl 
* Cucumber 
* GitHub
* Jenkins
* Junit etc. 
  
# Summary 

* Agile methodology is the iterative model of software development that helps in developing a product in a lesser time. 
* There are two types of testing techniques - manual and automation testing. 
* Static Testing is the testing without executing the actual code. 
* Dynamic testing is used to validate the functionality of the code by executing them. 
* In black-box testing, a tester is unware of the internal implementions of the software.
* While performing white-box testing, a tester is through with the internal implementations of the software.
